* https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/ but have to also return position of where the word was found in the matrix and need to go only in right and down directions in the matrix. Word is guaranteed to be in the matrix.
Multiple words are given for searching in the word search problem (2) but each letter in the matrix can only be used towards one word. Not completely sure if the objective was trying to match maximum words or returning the index of matching words (assuming all can be matched). Very few minutes were left for this so couldn't discuss much with the interviewer about this.
* I think I only provided some brute force solution but not sure if it was correct.
