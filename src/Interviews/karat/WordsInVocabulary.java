* word v is said to derive from word w if v can be obtained by rearranging the letters in w and adding one more letter (e.g. two -> wout). Given a list of vocabulary and a word w, return all words in the vocabulary that can be derived from w (either direct derivation or indirect derivation, so there can be intermediate steps between w and v)
Each word in the vocabulary has a value associated with it. Given (w, v), return the path whose sum of values are the largest.
